Scene Investigation\n\n\tCrime Scene Preservation: Establish a perimeter to avoid evidence tampering. \n\n\tPhotography and Documentation: Capture photos and videos of the scene, including damaged property, stolen items, and any evidence left behind. \n\n\tEvidence Collection:\n\n\t\tFingerprints\n\n\t\tFootprints or tire marks\n\n\t\tBlood or other biological evidence\n\n\t\tWeapons or tools used in the robbery\n\n\t\tSurveillance footage from nearby cameras\n\n\tSketching the Scene: Create detailed sketches for reference. \n\n3. Victim and Witness Statements\n\n\tDetailed Interviews: Take formal statements from victims and witnesses, noting descriptions of the suspect, stolen items, and the sequence of events. \n\n\tComposite Sketches: If possible, work with sketch artists to create a suspect portrait. \n\n4. Investigative Follow-up\n\n\tSurveillance Review: Analyze footage from CCTV cameras. \n\n\tPhone Records and Digital Evidence: Examine relevant phone calls, messages, or GPS data. \n\n\tCheck Criminal Records: Compare the suspect's description with known offenders. \n\n\tWitness Identification: Conduct line-ups or photo arrays for potential identification. \n\n5. Forensic Analysis\n\n\tSubmit evidence to forensic labs for fingerprint analysis, DNA testing, or ballistic examination if firearms were used. \n\n6. Suspect Interrogation\n\n\tIf a suspect is apprehended, conduct interviews using lawful interrogation techniques to gather information or obtain a confession. \n\n7. Report and Documentation\n\n\tCompile a detailed investigation report, including findings, evidence, statements, and conclusions. \n\n8.
